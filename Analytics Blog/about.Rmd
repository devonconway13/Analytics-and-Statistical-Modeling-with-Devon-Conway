title: "About Devon Conway"
description: "I’m currently a master’s student at Northeastern University studying
  analytics and statistical modeling. To back track, I attended the University of
  Tampa to acquire my bachelor's degree in finance. While at UT, I was a member of
  the women’s soccer team and sports editor for the school newspaper. I learned a
  lot during my time at UT, but it was not until I started working with the Tampa
  Bay Lightning in the hockey operations department doing analytics that I felt an
  intense passion about my work. As with life, a lot of trial and error happening
  when I decided take a job I was not fully passionate about with the Florida Panthers.
  When COVID first hit, I decided life was too short to wake up everyday without a
  true yearn to do my work. I decided to earn my yoga teaching certification and start
  my master’s program. I’m 3/4 of the way done my program, and I decided to start
  the website as a resume builder but to also showcase my passion for analytics and
  hockey. \nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my french bulldog, watching
  hockey, relaxing at a local coffee shop, working out, and eating a plant-based diet.
  I’ll leave you with my favorite quote, “Don’t Fail The Plan, Make The Plan Fail
  You.”
